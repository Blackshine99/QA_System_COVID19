# QA_System_COVID19

We attempt to create a universal platform where common users can input any query that they have about the Covid-19 pandemic, and most relevant FAQs are retrieved and shown to the user. For the FAQ retrieval, a dataset of commonly asked Covid-19 questions is amassed from various government websites, and other reliable sources. Based on the input query, the top 3 questions which have highest similarity rating are retrieved along with their corresponding answers.
